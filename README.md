# RockPaperScissor

https://www.hackingwithswift.com/guide/ios-swiftui/2/3/challenge

- Make a brain training game that challenges players to win or lose at rock, paper, scissors.

## Scenario:

- Each turn of the game the app will randomly pick either rock, paper, or scissors.
- Each turn the app will alternate between prompting the player to win or lose.
- The player must then tap the correct move to win or lose the game.
- If they are correct they score a point; otherwise they lose a point.
- The game ends after 10 questions, at which point their score is shown.
- So, if the app chose “Rock” and “Win” the player would need to choose “Paper”, but if the app chose “Rock” and “Lose” the player would need to choose “Scissors”.
